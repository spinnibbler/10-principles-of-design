        <h1>Back in the early 1980s,</h1>
        <p>Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the state of the world around him—“an impenetrable
            confusion
            of forms, colors and noises.” Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself an
            important question: Is my design good design?</p>
        <br>
        <p>As good design cannot be measured in a finite way, he set about expressing the ten most important principles
            for
            what he considered to be good design:

        <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always
            offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with
            innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

        <h1>Good design makes a product useful.</h1>
        <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also
            psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
            that could possibly detract from it.</p>
